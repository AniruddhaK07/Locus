# Locus — Development Progress & Log

## Resume here

- **Current Phase:** Phase 3 complete — starting Phase 4 (Amenity profile).
- **Done in Phase 3:**
  - Implemented `PhotonGeocodingProvider` (`src/engine/providers/geocoding/photon.ts`) for typeahead place suggestions with GeoJSON parsing.
  - Implemented `NominatimGeocodingProvider` (`src/engine/providers/geocoding/nominatim.ts`) for on-submit city resolution, identifying administrative relations or falling back to exact bounding box with zero padding.
  - Implemented `OverpassLocalityProvider` (`src/engine/providers/localities/overpass.ts`) querying `nwr["place"~"^(suburb|neighbourhood|quarter)$"]` inside area IDs or bounding boxes, extracting centroids across nodes, ways, and relations.
  - Implemented geographic utilities (`src/engine/domain/geo.ts`) for Haversine distances, locality name normalization, spatial deduplication within 500m, and anchor-relative candidate ranking.
  - Created parser test suite `tests/parsers.test.ts` (10 tests) verifying parsers against recorded fixtures (`photon-koramangala.json`, `nominatim-bengaluru.json`, `nominatim-pune.json`, `overpass-locality-bengaluru.json`).
  - Created and executed live smoke test script `scripts/smoke.ts` (`npm run smoke`) verifying ≥ 12 real localities discovered for Bengaluru (metro, 1,069 discovered) and Pune (smaller/node city, 138 discovered) with zero hardcoded data.
  - Verified `npm run check` passes 100% (42 unit tests across 5 test suites).
- **In progress:** Phase 4 — Amenity profile.
- **Exact next step:** Implement single-request multi-category amenity count query (`.set out count;`), relative normalization (`log1p` + min-max), and coverage/confidence indicators.
- **How to check:**
  ```bash
  npm run check
  npm run smoke
  ```
- **Known gaps:**
  - Multi-modal routing uses `routing.openstreetmap.de` (car, bike, foot verified; demo host `router.project-osrm.org` only supports driving).
  - Overpass mirrors from the Roland Olbricht cluster share the same IP slot pool; request rate must be queued with ≥ 700 ms spacing and concurrency 1.
  - When city resolves to a node (like Pune), either `is_in` enclosing boundary or exact geocoder bounding box fallback is used.
  - Transit mode (metro/bus schedule routing) is unverified and disabled in v1.
  - Rent data from listing portals is unavailable via unauthenticated API; starter tier-band heuristic + user override is used.

## Phase 2 Verification & Acceptance Results

1. **Commands Executed:**
   - `npm run check` $\rightarrow$ Passed (0 TS errors, 0 ESLint errors/warnings, 32 unit tests passed).
2. **Acceptance Criteria Verification:**
   - Queue ordering: Verified FIFO in `tests/infra.test.ts`.
   - Queue spacing & concurrency: Verified spacing $\ge$ minSpacingMs and concurrent active tasks $\le$ concurrency.
   - Retries & Backoff: Verified exponential backoff with jitter on 429 and 503.
   - Mirror Failover: Verified automated rotation from primary to secondary mirror on 500 error.
   - Abort Propagation: Verified caller `AbortSignal` cancels waiting tasks and running requests.
   - Cache TTL: Verified `MemoryStorageAdapter` and `ResponseCache` expire stale entries after TTL.
   - Zero bare `fetch` in feature code: Verified.

## Phase 3 Verification & Acceptance Results

1. **Commands Executed:**
   - `npm run check` $\rightarrow$ Passed (0 TS errors, 0 ESLint errors/warnings, 42 unit tests passed across 5 suites).
   - `npm run smoke` $\rightarrow$ Passed live smoke verification for Bengaluru (metro) and Pune (node city) with zero hardcoded data.
2. **Acceptance Criteria Verification:**
   - Parser tests: Tested against recorded fixtures `photon-koramangala.json`, `nominatim-bengaluru.json`, `nominatim-pune.json`, `overpass-locality-bengaluru.json` in `tests/parsers.test.ts`.
   - Centroids: Extracted across nodes, ways, and relations using `lat ?? center.lat`, `lon ?? center.lon`.
   - Stable IDs: Formatted consistently as `{type}/{id}` (e.g. `node/7301358178`, `way/257906450`).
   - Deduplication: Normalized names and 500m proximity threshold verified; prioritizes relation/way geometry over nodes.
   - Anchor distance ranking: Candidates ordered ascending by Haversine distance to primary workplace/anchor.
   - Bounding box fallback: Pune node fallback with exact bounding box and zero padding verified live.
